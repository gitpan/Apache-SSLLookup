Revision history for Perl extension Apache::SSLLookup

2.00_01  11.02.2004
  - original version

2.00_02  11.11.2004
  - test updates - no code changes

2.00_03  04.13.2005
  - updates for mod_perl 2.0-RC5 (1.999_22)
  - add ext_lookup() method but keep undocumented until
    I figure out how it works.  at the moment it seems
    to work except it never returns anything but undef,
    which may be a problem with the certs I'm generating.
